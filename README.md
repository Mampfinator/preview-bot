## Contributing

This bot is not supposed to be super complex, but contributions are always welcome!

If you'd like to add a major feature (such as support for a new site), I'd appreciate it if you [open an Issue](https://github.com/Mampfinator/preview-bot/issues/new) first or reach out to me on Discord.
